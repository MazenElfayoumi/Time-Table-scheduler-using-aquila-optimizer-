# Time Table scheduler using aquila optimizer 
 This project is a Python-based timetable scheduler that uses the Aquila Optimizer, a nature-inspired algorithm modeled after the hunting behavior of the Aquila bird, to efficiently schedule exams. The scheduler takes into account various constraints, such as available timeslots, the number of exams, and potential conflicts, to create an optimized exam timetable.
